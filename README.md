# NVIDIA-Isaac-Sim-and-Isaac-ROS-Integration-on-Jetson-Orin-Nano
This repository provides a detailed guide on integrating NVIDIA Isaac Sim with Isaac ROS on the Jetson Orin Nano, utilizing JetPack 6 for efficient AprilTag detection. This setup enhances robotics workflows by enabling real-time AprilTag detection and visualization.
# Overview

This project demonstrates how to:

   1. Simulate and Detect AprilTags: Use NVIDIA Isaac Sim to simulate a robotics environment and detect AprilTags.
   2. Process Data with Isaac ROS: Transfer AprilTag data to Isaac ROS on the Jetson Orin Nano.
   3. Visualize in RViz: Use RViz for real-time visualization of AprilTag detections.
   4. Leverage JetPack 6: Optimize performance on the Jetson Orin Nano.
   5. Implement Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) Testing: Connect the Jetson Orin Nano with a laptop for enhanced testing and validation.

# Requirements

   1. NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano: Ensure your device is set up with JetPack 6.
   2. NVIDIA Isaac Sim: For simulating the robotics environment.
   3. Isaac ROS: Installed on the Jetson Orin Nano.
   4. Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) Setup: For connecting the Jetson Orin Nano with a laptop.
