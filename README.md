# NVIDIA Isaac Sim and Isaac ROS Integration on Jetson Orin Nano

This repository provides a detailed guide on integrating NVIDIA Isaac Sim with Isaac ROS on the Jetson Orin Nano, utilizing JetPack 6 for efficient AprilTag detection. This setup enhances robotics workflows by enabling real-time AprilTag detection and visualization.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to:

- **Simulate and Detect AprilTags**: Use NVIDIA Isaac Sim to simulate a robotics environment and detect AprilTags.
- **Process Data with Isaac ROS**: Transfer AprilTag data to Isaac ROS on the Jetson Orin Nano.
- **Visualize in RViz**: Use RViz for real-time visualization of AprilTag detections.
- **Leverage JetPack 6**: Optimize performance on the Jetson Orin Nano.
- **Implement Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) Testing**: Connect the Jetson Orin Nano with a laptop for enhanced testing and validation.

## Requirements

- **NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano**: Ensure your device is set up with JetPack 6.
- **NVIDIA Isaac Sim**: For simulating the robotics environment.
- **Isaac ROS**: Installed on the Jetson Orin Nano.
- **Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) Setup**: For connecting the Jetson Orin Nano with a laptop.

## Installation and Setup

### 1. Setting Up Jetson Orin Nano

1. **Flash JetPack 6**: Use the NVIDIA SDK Manager to flash JetPack 6 on your Jetson Orin Nano.
   - [NVIDIA SDK Manager](https://developer.nvidia.com/sdk-manager)

2. **Install Isaac ROS**: Follow the instructions to install Isaac ROS on the Jetson Orin Nano.
   - [Isaac ROS Documentation](https://nvidia-isaac-ros.github.io/)

### 2. Configuring Network and ROS DDS Domain ID

1. **Network Configuration**: Connect your Jetson Orin Nano to the network. Optionally, configure a static IP address.

2. **Set Up ROS DDS Domain ID**:
   - Edit your ROS 2 workspace setup file to include the `ROS_DOMAIN_ID` environment variable.
   - Source the setup file to apply changes.

### 3. Integrating Isaac Sim with Isaac ROS

1. **Simulate AprilTags in Isaac Sim**: Run your simulation and detect AprilTags.
